#AspNetAdapterMiddlewareSandbox

This is a sandbox for developing AspNetAdapter and Middleware ideas.

##Usage

This is a Visual Studio 2013 solution that shows how to use the adapter and a
middleware. 

Basically this provides an empty web project that funnels all HTTP requests 
through the adapter and prints a Hello, World message on the browser.
